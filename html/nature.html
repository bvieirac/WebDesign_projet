            <h1> Levadas</h1>
            <p>Going to Madeira and not taking a 'levada'  means missing out on one of the most fascinating experiences the archipelago has to offer.
                They are irrigation channels or aqueducts created with the aim of taking water from the north (where it is abundant) to the
                 south of the island, more habitable and where most of the plantations have always been established. In total, the
                  Madeira Island has an impressive 2000 km of levadas and many
                of them can be traversed on foot. You can walk until you fall to the side!
            </p>

                    connecting the two highest peaks of Madeira, it is a sensational hike, 
                    with tunnels, a few steep climbs and descents and breathtaking views of the heart of the Massif Central.

                        This trail of 2,8km and duration of 1.30 hours allows you to get to the highest summit

                        Visiting some of the finest cliff scenery on Madeira, this walk explores the long thin peninsula 
                        at the eastern end of the island. The paths are good, 
                        but undulating - whether you get close to the edges is up to you.</p>

                Beginning in the Queimadas Forestry Park, this walk is 'out-and-back', and crosses some spectacularly steep slopes, 
                but is one of the finest ways of penetrating the deep valley of the São Jorge brook on foot. 
                You'll need a torch on this walk, which passes through a tunnel.</p>
