                     <p class="descryption" >Located 22km from funcal, this municipality has great historical significance.
                        It was here that Gonçalves Zarco and Tristão Vaz Teixeira landed in 1419, 
                        when they discovered Madeira.</p>

                         Santana is located on the north coast of Madeira island. 
                        Because the municipality was inaccessible by sea and land, its inhabitants have preserved features that have not 
                        suffered outside influences. One example that comes from this isolation is the typical architectural style of their houses with
                         thatched roofs known as “casinhas de Santana” (little houses of Santana).</p>

                        This municipality has the Paul da Serra, which is distinguished for being the only plateau on the island of Madeira, 
                        and this at an altitude of 1,500 m. This site has unique natural features, as nuclei of

            with the emblematic road connecting Porto Moniz to São Vicente. This road is occasionally crossed by waterfalls that flow into the 
                         This is considered one of the most beautiful roads in wood. For safety reasons, today there

                     <p class="descryption" >Porto Santo is the second largest island of the Autonomous Region of Madeira, 
                        The island is known for its large fine yellow sandy beach, stretching close to 9 km, running along the island's 
                        entire southern coastline. Above all, it offers peace and quiet and a catching charm, which doesn't

                        The name of this city comes from the fact that at the time of the discovery of the island loads of sea
                        lions were sighted at that cove that still retains the same configuration.This land of fishermen, whose main expertise 
                        is the fishing for black scabbardfish, owes its fame to the fishermen
                        who paint the bay with their picturesque and very distinctive boats - the "Xavelhas".</p>
