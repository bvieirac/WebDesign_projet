            <h1>Main Events</h1>     
            <p>Our archipelago is known for its breathtaking landscapes and its absolutely stunning natural heritage, but Madeira also offers an extremely diverse calendar of events throughout the year, which will certainly make your experience even more enriching and authentic, either for its traditions or for its cultural variety.</p>
            <p>The Christmas and New Year celebrations are very popular with the many tourists who visit us at this time of year (of course, the mild climate also helps!). Preparations for these festivities begin in November when the lights that illuminate the entire island throughout the Christmas season are turned on. Until January, a lot happens in Funchal, such as concerts, shows and lots of fun. One of the funniest nights, full of Christmas spirit, is the Market Night on the 23rd of December when the Mercado dos Lavradores remains open all night and Madeirans and visitors alike gather in the streets and taverns around the market to shopping, singing Christmas carols, eating and drinking until the early hours.</p>

            <h1>Flower Fest</h1>
            <p>The Flower Festival, that takes place in spring when the flowers are at their best, has been one of Madeira's major attractions for both tourists and locals for a long time. This enchanting festival, with parade and floats through the streets of Funchal, exhibits and perfumes the air with a multiplicity of floral species of the island, spreading a fairy tale ambiance all over the city centre. In every year’s edition, each group of adults and children presents their colourful costumes (decorated with flowers typical of the archipelago) accompanied with dances to a newly conceived choreography. At Largo do Colégio (Colégio Square) you will find the so-called 'Wall of Hope'a wall where children place their own flowers with the objective of building a big flower wall symbolising the hope for a better and more peaceful world. As part of this event there are other activities, like the making of flower carpets in the streets, awarding of prizes for the best-decorated shop window, performances of traditional music groups, a flower exhibition at Praça do Povo, classical and traditional music concerts and a number of variety shows.</p>

            <h1>New Years Evee</h1>
            <p>The New Year Celebrations in Madeira are out of this world! On December 31st, the atmosphere in the city centre becomes more excited and elated as the day progresses with bands and folklore groups providing a vast array of entertainment for both residents and visitors to the island. Throughout the day cruise liners either dock or moor out in the bay, their towering splendour, lights and on-board fireworks preparing everyone for the excitement yet to come. On occasions, ships crews have been known to serenade spectators as they provide their own crowd-pleasing entertainment by orchestrating and performing a 'ships horn fantasia. Normally around twelve cruise liners are moored in and around the bay waiting for that all-important stroke of midnight when the skies of Madeira shine, glimmer and reverberate as the islands all-important fireworks light up the heavens in a beautiful orchestration of colour, shapes and awe-inspiring beauty.</p>

            <h1>Christmas Market</h1>
            <p>The Christmas lights in Santa Cruz are already sparkling for the holidays, and the city of Funchal and the rest of the island will be lit up on December 1st. Christmas Lights Switch On 1st DecemberExtraordinary, amazing and unmissable, It's Christmas, a magical time in Madeira, where the streets of Funchal and other towns around the island including Porto Santo are bathed in a kaleidoscope of colour, brilliance and beauty.The switching on of the Christmas lights at the beginning of December heralds the start of the 'silly' season, and no one can fail to be impressed by the dazzling lights, static displays, and abundance of flowers, including Poinsettia towers, which enliven Madeira's capital twenty-four hours a day. (The city of Funchal and the rest of the island will be lit up from 18:00 to 01:00 on December 1st until January 8th. There are some exceptions: on the 25th and 30th, they are on until 04:00, and on the 23rd, 24th, and 31st, until 06:00 am.) If you have lights, you must have music. Philharmonic bands, Mandolin concerts, performances by the Madeira Orchestra as well as the islands choirs and choral societies all produce some of their most beautiful and dramatic works to celebrate the season of goodwill. Whether these are intimate concerts, open-air productions, church recitals, the organisers are adept at adapting to any location, including shopping centres.</p>
