                <h3> Caco's Cake</h3>
                 <p class="descryption" >
                    Bolo do Caco is an ex-libris of Madeiran gastronomy. Despite having the name "cake", this is 
                    actually a type of bread.

                    Bolo do Caco is a food that establishes a connection between Madeiran bread and bread with an 
                    Arab influence. Made with wheat flour, homemade yeast, water and salt, it is kneaded and after rising, the dough 
                    is cut into rounded and flattened pieces.
                    This bread is best eaten hot with garlic butter.

                     <p class="descryption" >The most typical fish of Madeira Island is the black scabbard fish “Espada“, which swims in deep 
                        waters and has a scary appearance, at least when viewed in the market. However, it is also very tasty, especially 
                        when prepared the “Madeiran Way”, with passion fruit and banana sauce.</p>

                         avocados are undoubtedly an endless delight. Why not to try the tabaibos, also called “figs of the devil”? These fruits,
                          from a species of cactus, are appreciated for their juicy freshness. Pass through the Farmers Market (Funchal or 
                          Ribeira Brava) and sample some of these fruits for free. A number of tropical fruits are well worth a try.</p>
