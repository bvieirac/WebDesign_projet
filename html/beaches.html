            <h1> Beaches</h1>
            <p>If you are looking for coconuts and golden sandy beaches, then with it's black volcanic sand, Madeira Island is 
                probably not the place for you. However, the island's beaches are popular for their high standards, crystal clear water
                and pleasant temperatures.And golden sand may be found in Calheta and Machico where it has been imported especially! With
                 many of Madeira's beaches being pebbled, comfort is not a word that immediately comes to mind. Beach mats are always a good idea!
                But there are also some wonderful sandy beaches and excellent pools. The jewel in the crown is of course the 9 kilometre 
                golden beach of Porto Santo. Whatever your preference, find it below!
